## The Pennsylvania Capital Semester
![PA House Chamber]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized PAHouseChamber_001.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-right}
Started in fall 2009, the Institute for Public Affairs sponsors an internship semester each fall and spring semester in Harrisburg in association with Temple’s [Harrisburg campus](http://www.temple.edu/harrisburg/). Students have the opportunity to explore government affairs, policymaking and implementation first-hand while being full-time students and staying on track to graduation. Applications are being accepted on a rolling basis. We encourage students from schools other than Temple University to apply as well. Watch a video on the program below.

## The Internship
![Interns with Lt Gov]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized2019lut_govwithstudents.jpg){:.responsive-img .img-center}
- This program is open to students of any major and college at Temple University as well as students of other colleges or universities, and is modeled on a study abroad placement. Students will experience total immersion in state institutions and state politics in Harrisburg.
- Past students in the program were majors in: Economics, Finance, Social Work, Public Relations, Journalism, Broadcast Journalism, Criminal Justice, Sociology, Philosophy, and Political Science, but students from any major can apply.
- Placements include executive branch agencies, the state legislature, and government related private and non-profit employers. Placements are also individualized to each student, as Temple establishes the initial contacts and sets up interviews, if need be. See a partial list of [internship placement options](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/sites/liberalarts/files/PACapitalSemesterInternshipSites.pdf).
- Some internships are paid, but some are not. The state has suspended most paid internships, but there are some available according to office placement.
- Depending on placement, interns will work on specific legislation, legislative analysis, constituent service, policy research, organizing meetings, public relations, grassroots campaigns, special events, press releases, writing newsletters, economic development projects, writing news stories, reporting on legislative hearings, lobbying, advocacy for particular policies/groups, information systems or web design & maintenance, or placement in the Capitol newsroom.
- Internships might involve outside activities, such as fundraisers, press conferences, receptions and other special events.

## Academic Program
![Margaret and Rep Stern]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized_margaret_stern.png){:.responsive-img .img-right}
The full semester consists of the internship of 3-9 credits (generally 10 to 30 hours of internship experience) an internship seminar (3 credits) and State Politics and Policy (3 credits). Both are political science courses. Most students take 9 credits of an internship, plus the two courses, for a full semester of 15 credits. Students can also sign up for an additional course, or courses, in their respective departments, most likely online or independent study.

**PS 2107: Internship Seminar: Public-Private Cooperation in Public Policymaking and Program Implementation.** This course includes strategies for getting the most out of an internship, a context for the internship experience –the basic interactions between the public and private sectors at the state and local level, a special focus on interaction between the state executive branch; legislature and the legislative process; nonprofits, advocacy organizations, lobbying or trade associations; and local economic development organizations. The syllabus will include a block of instruction on public policy analysis, and students will complete a policy analysis project related to their internships. 

**PS 3500: State Politics and Policy.** This course examines the institutions, politics and policy making of American state governments with special emphasis on the Commonwealth of PA. It also examines the state’s special place in the structure of American federalism and how this has changed over time, and explores why state governments often produce different solutions to similar problems. **This course counts as a research preparation class in political science.**
